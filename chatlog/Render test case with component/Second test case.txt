Test Case: Client Connectivity Diagnostics - Selecting Scope of APs

Test Steps:
1. Open the WEB GUI and navigate to the Client Connectivity Diagnostics tool.
2. Follow the provided steps to access the tool:
   - Enter the MAC address of the client device with connectivity issues in the Client MAC field.
   - Select a Venue from the drop-down list in the Venus field.
   - Click the "Select" button in the Select APs field to display the AP list.
   - Select multiple available APs from the list to establish communication between the client and the controller.
   - Click the "Trace Connectivity" button to start the troubleshooting process.
3. Verify that the selected APs are included in the diagnostic scope.
4. Ensure that the entered MAC address and selected APs successfully initiate the connectivity trace.
5. Verify that the following items are displayed during the troubleshooting process for each selected AP:
   - AP MAC
   - AP Name
   - SSID
   - Radio
   - Failure Type
6. Observe the flow diagram that depicts the different stages of the AP-client connection.
7. Ensure that colored arrows are used to indicate warnings (yellow) or failures (red) during the connection process.
8. Verify that the tool analyzes the frames exchanged between the client device and the selected APs.
9. Confirm that the tool accurately identifies the specific stage causing the connection problems for each selected AP.
10. Verify that information about the selected APs involved in the connection attempt is displayed, including their names, MAC addresses, operating channels, and connection failures.
11. Observe the status of the client during the connection process:
   - "Client is in a discovery state and not currently connected" (when the tool starts or when the client is already connected to an AP)
   - "Client is attempting a new connection" (when the target client sends an 802.11 authentication request frame to an AP to initiate a connection)
12. Validate that the tool accurately represents the connection status and updates it based on the client's actions for each selected AP.
13. Ensure that warnings and failures, such as time delays, unsupported EAP types, or connection failures, are appropriately highlighted in the flow diagram.
14. Complete the troubleshooting process and verify that the tool provides relevant and accurate information for diagnosing and troubleshooting connectivity issues with the selected APs and client devices.

Expected Results:
- The Client Connectivity Diagnostics tool is accessible through the provided steps.
- The selected APs are included in the diagnostic scope.
- Entering a valid MAC address and selecting multiple APs successfully initiate the connectivity trace.
- The displayed items (AP MAC, AP Name, SSID, Radio, Failure Type) are correct and relevant for each selected AP.
- The flow diagram accurately represents the different stages of the AP-client connection.
- Colored arrows indicate warnings (yellow) or failures (red) during the connection process.
- The tool analyzes frames and accurately identifies the specific stage causing the connection problems for each selected AP.
- Information about the selected APs involved in the connection attempt is displayed correctly.
- The client's status during the connection process is accurately represented.
- Warnings and failures are appropriately highlighted in the flow diagram.
- The tool provides relevant and accurate information for diagnosing and troubleshooting connectivity issues with the selected APs and client devices.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a WPA2-PSK network:

1. On the navigation bar, click Wi-Fi > Wi-Fi Networks > Wi-Fi Networks List.
2. The Networks page will be displayed.
3. Click "Add Wi-Fi Network" or select a PSK network setting to clone from the table.
4. The Create New Network page will be displayed.
5. In the Network Details tab, complete the following settings:
   - Network Name: Enter a name (up to 32 characters) for the network.
   - Set different SSID: Choose this option if you want to configure a different SSID from the network name.
   - Description: Enter a description (up to 64 characters) to identify the network.
   - Network Type: Select "Pre-Shared Key (PSK)".
6. Click "Next".
7. The PSK Settings tab will be displayed.
8. Complete the settings on the PSK Settings tab:
   - Passphrase: Enter a minimum eight-character passphrase for users to access the network.
   - Security Protocol: Select "WPA2" as the security protocol (unless you have a specific reason to choose otherwise).
   - Management Frame Protection (802.11w): Choose "Disabled," "Optional," or "Required".
   - MAC Authentication: Toggle the switch to ON if you want to enable this feature and configure MAC registration.
9. Click "Show more settings" to expand the options.
10. Configure additional settings as needed:
    - VLAN settings: Specify the VLAN ID or enable VLAN pooling.
    - Proxy ARP: Toggle the switch to ON if you want to enable proxy ARP.
    - Services settings: Enable or configure DNS Proxy, Wi-Fi Calling, Client Isolation, Anti-spoofing, etc.
    - Radio settings: Configure options like Load Control, Access Control, OFDM, Data Rate Control, etc.
    - Optimized Connectivity Experience (OCE): Set the switch to ON and configure relevant parameters.
    - Venues: Select the venues where you want to activate the network.
11. Click "Next".
12. Review the Venues page and make necessary selections for venue activation, AP groups, radio bands, and scheduling.
13. Click "Apply".
14. On the Summary page, review the configured settings, and click the eye icon to display the passphrase in plain text if desired.
15. Finally, click "Finish" to complete the creation of the WPA2-PSK network.

That's it! You have now created a WPA2-PSK network with the specified settings.

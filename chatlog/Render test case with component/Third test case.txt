Test Case: Client Connectivity Diagnostics - Diagnosis Start and Stop

Test Steps:
1. Open the WEB GUI and navigate to the Client Connectivity Diagnostics tool.
2. Follow the provided steps to access the tool:
   - Enter the MAC address of the client device with connectivity issues in the Client MAC field.
   - Select a Venue from the drop-down list in the Venus field.
   - Click the "Select" button in the Select APs field to display the AP list.
   - Select an available AP from the list to establish communication between the client and the controller.
   - Click the "Trace Connectivity" button to start the troubleshooting process.
3. Verify that the connectivity trace is initiated, and the diagnostic process begins.
4. Observe the ongoing troubleshooting process and ensure that the following items are displayed:
   - AP MAC
   - AP Name
   - SSID
   - Radio
   - Failure Type
5. Monitor the flow diagram that depicts the different stages of the AP-client connection.
6. Verify that colored arrows indicate warnings (yellow) or failures (red) during the connection process.
7. Validate that the tool analyzes the frames exchanged between the client device and the selected APs.
8. Confirm that the tool accurately identifies the specific stage causing the connection problems.
9. Verify that information about the APs involved in the connection attempt is displayed, including their names, MAC addresses, operating channels, and connection failures.
10. Observe the status of the client during the connection process:
    - "Client is in a discovery state and not currently connected" (when the tool starts or when the client is already connected to an AP)
    - "Client is attempting a new connection" (when the target client sends an 802.11 authentication request frame to an AP to initiate a connection)
11. Validate that the tool accurately represents the connection status and updates it based on the client's actions.
12. Ensure that warnings and failures, such as time delays, unsupported EAP types, or connection failures, are appropriately highlighted in the flow diagram.
13. Test the functionality of the "Stop" button by clicking it during the diagnosis.
14. Verify that the diagnosis stops immediately after clicking the "Stop" button.
15. Confirm that monitoring ceases, but the user interface (UI) of the tool remains accessible.
16. Restart the diagnosis by clicking the "Trace Connectivity" button again.
17. Verify that the diagnostic process resumes and continues from where it left off.
18. Complete the troubleshooting process and verify that the tool provides relevant and accurate information for diagnosing and troubleshooting connectivity issues with client devices.

Expected Results:
- The Client Connectivity Diagnostics tool is accessible through the provided steps.
- The connectivity trace is initiated, and the diagnostic process begins successfully.
- The ongoing troubleshooting process displays the expected items (AP MAC, AP Name, SSID, Radio, Failure Type).
- The flow diagram accurately represents the different stages of the AP-client connection.
- Colored arrows indicate warnings (yellow) or failures (red) during the connection process.
- The tool analyzes frames and accurately identifies the specific stage causing the connection problems.
- Information about the APs involved in the connection attempt is displayed correctly.
- The client's status during the connection process is accurately represented.
- Warnings and failures are appropriately highlighted in the flow diagram.
- The "Stop" button effectively stops the diagnosis when clicked, while retaining the UI.
- Restarting the diagnosis resumes the process from where it left off.
- The tool provides relevant and accurate information for diagnosing and troubleshooting connectivity issues with client devices.

    <h1>Test Case for Troubleshooting Client Connections</h1>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Verify the Troubleshooting Client Connections function</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Steps:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch the network monitoring application.</li>
            <li>Select Monitor from the main menu.</li>
            <li>Select Troubleshooting from the Troubleshooting & Diagnostics menu.</li>
            <li>Select the Client Connection option from the Type dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Select the client device from the client list dropdown or enter the MAC address of the client device with connectivity issues.</li>
            <li>Select an Access Point (AP) to communicate between the client and the controller.</li>
            <li>Click Start on the Connectivity Trace.</li>
            <li>Verify that the AP receives data frames from the target client and relays frames to the controller based on the client filter.</li>
            <li>Verify that the APs that receive probe requests from the target client are listed in a table, along with the AP's operating channel and the RSSI at which the clientâ€™s frames were received.</li>
            <li>Verify that the tool displays the statuses "Client is in a discovery state and not currently connected" (when the tool starts or when the client is already connected to an AP) and "Client is attempting a new connection" (when the target client sends an 802.11 authentication request frame to an AP to initiate a connection).</li>
            <li>Verify that the list of APs that communicated with the client is displayed and is used to determine whether the client chose the best AP based on signal quality and other health metrics.</li>
            <li>Verify that the flow diagram depicting different stages of the AP-client connection is initiated when the client sends an 802.11 authentication request frame.</li>
            <li>Verify that the Flow ladder in the diagram shows the step-by-step exchange of information between devices during the connection process.</li>
            <li>Verify that typical warning scenarios include time delays or a failed negotiation for an unsupported EAP type.</li>
            <li>Verify that failure conditions are also highlighted as red arrows, typically when the connection itself fails.</li>
            <li>Click Stop to terminate the connection between the AP and the client.</li>
            <li>Verify that the Troubleshooting Client Connections function works as expected.</li>
        </ol>

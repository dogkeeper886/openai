Enable OFDM only (Disables 802.11b): Select the check box to enable this option. Enabling this option disables CCK rates of 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, so no 802.11b-only clients can connect. Beacons and probe responses will be transmitted at 6 Mbps, and data frames at 6, 9, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Enforcing higher minimum data rates increases overall network throughput capacity, but reduces the distance at which clients are able to remain connected.
OFDM
